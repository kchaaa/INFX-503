					<p> Ballard is honestly probably my favorite part of Seattle. Coming from a more suburban area, it really clicks with me. The area and the people are all around nice. If I were to choose to live anywhere in Seattle, I would definitely would live in Ballard. Although there are farmer's markets in every neighborhood of Seattle, I believe Ballard's is the best! There are food places to eat at, many deserts to dine on afterwards, and nice tea and coffee places you can go to relax. Here are a few attractions you should definitely check out while there: </p> <br>
					<p> The most notable part of Ballard is <strong>Golden Gardens</strong>. Golden Gardens is probably the nicest beach in Seattle and a nice place to have a bonfire. The area is surrounded by nature for those who love nature. There is also a mini marsh in the back and a nice little field to walk around. There is a fleet of sailboats nearby as well. One thing to note is that it is very distant from the main part of Ballard, but I believe the trip is worth it. The lesser-known part is the <strong>Edith Macefield House</strong>. If you know the famous Pixar movie <em>Up</em>. The part of the story regarding why Carl Fredricksen refused to sell his house despite many offers to pay his property. Her house is located between two big buildings like in the movie. Unfortunately, Edith has passed away, but people live her memory on by tying balloons to the gates surrounding the house. </p>
