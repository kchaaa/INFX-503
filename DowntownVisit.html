					<p> Downtown Seattle is probably what people imagine when they think of Seattle. They think about Pike's Place Market, the Space Needle, Century Link Field, and Safeco Stadium. I personally believe there is more to Downtown Seattle than just those 4 places. This is probably the part of Seattle that will make sure you will never be bored. </p> <br>
					<p> Near Pike's Place, there is the <strong>Seattle Art Museum (SAM)</strong>. The museum has very interesting exhibits. If you go towards the pier, you will see <strong>Pier 57</strong> where there are amazing sights such as the <strong>Seattle Great Wheel</strong> and the <strong>Seattle Aquarium</strong>. </p> <br>
					<p> If you don't know the picture above, it's the <strong> Columbia Center</strong>. The Columbia Center is the tallest skyscraper in Seattle that makes the Space Needle look like an ant! It helps that it is much cheaper and less of a wait. It is probably my favorite place in Downtown. Nearby the Columbia Center, there is the <strong> Seattle Public Library</strong>. The architecture alone will amaze you. The library is super tall meaning it has a very wide selection. </p> <br>
					<p> Close to the Space Needle, there is many fun places to visit such as an amazing museum known as the <strong> EMP </strong>; a beautiful sight at the <strong> Glass museum</strong>; a science museum with amazing exhibits known as <strong> Pacific Place</strong>; and a <strong> circular foundtain</strong> to go especially during the Spring/Summer. </p> <br>
					<p> Last, but not least, you cannot miss the places surrounding the stadium. <strong>Pioneer Square</strong> has a very historical feeling to it and is close to a lot of sports bars. And a 5 minute walk away is the <strong>International District</strong>. This is the home of Asian culture in Seattle. With places like Chinatown and Little Vietnam inside the district, you can see the variety of Asian culture and eat a lot of amazing Asian food.
