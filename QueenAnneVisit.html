					<p> To be honest, it was really hard to come up with the nickname "The Greater Area" for Queen Anne. Queen Anne is definitely the nicer and richer part of Seattle. The culture scene is definitely in Queen Anne though. <strong>McCaw Hall</strong> is famously known as the home of the Seattle Opera and Pacific Northwest Ballet. Many restaurants are in Queen Anne including famous Seattle chains like <strong>Pagliacci Pizza</strong> and <strong>Dick's Burgers</strong>. Queen Anne is home to businesses, culture, and food. </p> <br>
					<p> The most famous place to me is <strong>Kerry Park</strong>. Kerry Park is a small piece of land gives you an amazing view of Seattle with the Space Needle up front (as you can see in my picture above). When you see iconic photos of Seattle, this is where people will go. Many people come here to take a photo of themselves, their friends, and Seattle. I hope you bring a good camera to get the full experience. </p>
