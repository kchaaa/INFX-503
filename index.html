					<article> Hi my name is Kevin and I'm a sophomore at University of Washington for the intended major of Informatics. <br> Last year, I took a class called CSE 131 (Science and Art of Digital Photography). Before taking this class, I never took an interest in photography and did not know about the beauty of Seattle besides U-District, Pike's Place, and the Space Needle. I knew Seattle on a shallow basis and felt like a tourist. Thanks to CSE 131, I was given the opportunity and an excuse to explore Seattle. I fell love in with the different neighborhoods of Seattle and know more about the city than I know about my hometown, San Francisco. If you really want to start exploring, go on <a href = "https://www.google.com/maps"> google maps</a> and look up the directions. I hope by telling you about my experience visiting Downtown Seattle, Ballard, Fremont, and Queen Anne, they will convince you to also explore and fall in love with Seattle. </article>
