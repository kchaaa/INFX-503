					<p> After moving into the dorms last year, this was the first place I visited in Seattle. My sister was very hungry and decided to go on Yelp to check out any good restaurants nearby. One of the most famous restaurant in Seattle showed up, <strong>Paseo's</strong>. Paseo's definitely convinced me the name this neighborhood the 'food scene'. Paseo's was on Yelp's 'Top 100 Places to Eat in America'. Known for their pulled pork sandwich, Paseo's definitely deserves their spot on the list. Also nearby for those who don't want to wait in a long line is <strong>Uneeda Burger</strong>. Uneeda Burger has a lot of bomb burgers to try. They change 3 items on their menu every time I go. You will always be able to try something new! </p> <br>
					<p> Although the food scene is great, there are a few famous attractions of Fremont. The most known attraction is the <strong>Fremont Troll</strong>. The Fremont Troll is a big statue under the bridge that many people take a picture of. Fun Fact: the car underneath his hand is a real car. In the center of Fremont, the infamous <strong>Statue of Lenin</strong>. Acquired from Russia, Fremont proudly displays a statue of the notorious Communist leader from Russia. Despite many protests, the Statue of Lenin stays today strong and proud. If you cross the street from the statue, you will see a real spaceship attached to a building. It is not very big, but the fact that it is a real spaceship makes it a must-see. </p>
